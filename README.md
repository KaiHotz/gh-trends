# IMPORTANT !!!
Sadly `gh-trending-api.herokuapp.com` has no CORS support.
Therefor and to be able to fetch the Data you first need to opt in to CORS-anywhere.

Just go to [https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com) and request temporary acces to the demo server.

After that you'll see the fetched data eiter at the [Demo Page](https://kaihotz.github.io/gh-trends/)
or if you cloned/downloaded the project and ran it locally at your [local instance](http://localhost:3000/gh-trends)
